/**
 * Key-management endpoint the WebUI calls to list / inspect / delete AndroidKeyStore entries the
 * daemon (a real root Context) can reach. Minimal HTTP/1.1 over a FILESYSTEM unix-domain socket at
 * [Const.adminSocketFile], inside the 0700 root-only [Const.DATA_DIR]. A loopback TCP port would be
 * connectable by any app uid — and a service answering there fingerprints the module — so it is
 * served on a unix socket instead: the kernel refuses a connect() from any non-root caller, making
 * the endpoint invisible to every other app. The WebView cannot reach a unix socket directly, so
 * the WebUI drives it through its root-exec bridge and the shipped `teesim-uds` client. Every
 * request still carries the random admin token (defense in depth on top of the socket's
 * permissions); the peer uid is additionally checked to be root at accept time.
 *
 * Contract (all responses application/json; send header `X-Teesim-Token: <token>`): GET /status ->
 * { ok, version, harvest{...}, lib{hook,api} } GET /keys -> { ok, keys:[ {alias, securityLevel,
 * ours, cert{...}} ] } GET /keys/db[?refresh=1] -> { ok, available, apiLevel, keys:[ {id, alias,
 * uid, package, state, class, created?, keybox?, keyAlgorithm?, purposes?} ] } (target-app keys
 * with a stored attestation cert, from keystore2's DB on API >= 31; empty + available=false on
 * 10/11 where there is no such database. The uid->app mapping comes from the resolved snapshot;
 * refresh=1 — the WebUI's pull-to-refresh only — forces a live re-resolve instead) GET /scope -> {
 * ok, epoch, resolvedAtMs, baselineReady, profiles:[ {id, autoInclude, packages:[..],
 * explicitUids:[..], autoUids:[..]} ] } (what the last push actually targets, per profile; the only
 * place auto-included uids are visible, since the rule needs the root-only known_packages.json
 * baseline. Empty profiles[] with epoch 0 before the first push) POST /rescan -> { ok, uids }
 * (re-resolve against the live device and re-push; how a newly installed app is discovered, there
 * being no package watcher) GET /packages -> { ok, firstAppUid, apps:[ {uid, packages:[..], label,
 * system, launchable, enabled, installTime, freq, lastUsed, recent} ] } (every installed app, one
 * entry per uid, for the Scope picker: installTime = epoch ms of first install; freq = persistent
 * key-request count; lastUsed = epoch ms of last request; recent = requested a key since this boot)
 * POST /backend/conformance -> { ok, semantics, generatedAtMs, tee{...}, strongbox{...} } (runs
 * fresh AndroidKeyStore generate/use/attestation operations; never a cached status claim) GET
 * /icon?pkg=P&token=T -> raw image/png (query-token auth, like /logs/download; 404 when the
 * package has no icon) POST /usage/clear -> { ok, cleared } (wipes the frequency memory) POST
 * /keys/db/delete?ids=1,2,3 -> { ok, deleted, requested } (removes those keyentry ids from
 * keystore2, marker- and target-verified) GET /keys/inspect?alias=A -> { ok, alias,
 * attestation{...} | null } POST /keys/delete?alias=A -> { ok, deleted } GET /logs?after=N&max=M ->
 * { ok, lines:[{seq,level,tag,text}], nextAfter } GET /keybox/inspect?name=F -> { ok, name,
 * deviceId, revocationListAvailable, keys:[{algorithm, privateKeyPresent, chainLength, linkage,
 * rootAuthority(google|aosp|knox|unknown|none), googleSigned, chainVerified, revoked,
 * revocationChecked, certs:[{index, subject, issuer, serial, notBefore, notAfter, expired, sigAlg,
 * keyAlgorithm, keySize, isCa, selfSigned, signatureValid?, revocationChecked?, revoked?,
 * revocationStatus?, revocationReason?, rootAuthority?}]}] } POST /keybox/validate -> { ok,\n * capabilities:{rsa,ec,label}, keys:[{algorithm,chainLength,privateKeyMatchesLeaf}], warnings:[...] }\n * (validates raw XML before the WebUI atomically writes it) GET /canary -> { ok, currentCode,
 * latest{...}|null, updateAvailable } POST /canary/install?tag=&variant= -> { ok, message }
