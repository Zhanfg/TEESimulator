/**
 * Read/manage window into keystore2's on-disk database, so the WebUI can list and remove the keys
 * THIS MODULE generated for target apps (gms, key-attestation, …). Those keys live in keystore2's
 * per-app namespaces, not in the daemon's own AndroidKeyStore, so [KeyAdmin.listKeys] can never see
 * them. Only meaningful on Android 12+ (API 31+), where keystore2 replaced the legacy keystore; on
 * 10/11 there is no such database and [available] returns false.
 *
 * "Ours" is decided by fact, not heuristics: our KeyMint TA prepends the routing marker
 * `TEESIMkm\0` to every key blob it emits (teesim-km `BLOB_MARKER` / `mark_blob`), and keystore2
 * stores that blob in `blobentry`. A key whose blob starts with the marker is one we minted; every
 * other key on the device is ignored. (A key keystore2 super-encrypts before storing would hide the
 * marker, but the attestation keys these apps create are not auth-bound, so their blobs are stored
 * as the TA returned them.)
 *
 * The keybox that rooted a key is recovered from its stored certificate chain: a key is attributed
 * to a keybox only when its chain embeds that keybox's WHOLE signing chain (root through batch),
 * matched against [KeyboxInspector.signerChains]. Whether the leaf itself was batch-issued (the
 * generated / patched distinction) is a separate check against [KeyboxInspector.signerIndex].
 *
 * Reads never touch the live file: keystore2 owns persistent.sqlite in WAL mode under a live lock,
 * so we snapshot it (+ its -wal / -shm siblings) into a private dir under [Const.DATA_DIR], open
 * the COPY read-only, and delete the snapshot. Deletion is the one write path and DOES open the
 * live database — safely, because it is already a WAL database that supports a second writer (we
 * set a busy timeout and only ever remove rows we re-verify as our own target-app keys). Root can
 * read and write the keystore-owned files.
 *
 * Schema (AOSP system/security/keystore2/src/database.rs):
 * ```
 *   keyentry(id, key_type, domain, namespace, alias BLOB, state, km_uuid)
 *     domain    Domain::APP = 0  -> namespace is the app uid
 *     state     KeyLifeCycle: Live = 1 (usable), Existing = 0 (mid-create), Unreferenced = 2
 *     alias     UTF-8 text stored as a BLOB; CAST(... AS TEXT) so the cursor yields a String
 *   blobentry(id, subcomponent_type, keyentryid, blob)  -- the KM key blob and the attestation certs
 *   keymetadata(keyentryid, tag, data)  -- creation date = ms-since-epoch in an INTEGER `data` cell,
 *     recognised by SHAPE (a plausible epoch-millis integer) since the tag number drifts across releases.
 * ```
 *
 * Every path is wrapped so a schema/lock/IO surprise yields an empty result, never a throw.
