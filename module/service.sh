# the device's attestation parameters, resolves config.json into per-profile
# settings, injects the interceptor into keystore/keystore2, and pushes the resolved
# config over the control socket, re-injecting and re-pushing as things change. This
# script only launches the daemon and respawns it if it ever exits.
