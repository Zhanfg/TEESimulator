# keymint

The Android 12+ interceptor. It runs as a shared library injected into `keystore2`
and steers KeyMint transactions to an in-process software KeyMint backed by the
keybox, while leaving every other key on the real hardware.

On Android 12 and newer, `keystore2` doesn't hold KeyMint in-process — it talks to a
KeyMint HAL over Binder. That's the seam we splice into.

## Interception point

The obvious move would be to hand `keystore2` a different binder when it resolves
KeyMint. Too late: `keystore2` resolves the KeyMint HAL once at boot and caches the
binder for the life of the process (see [`get_keymint_device` in keystore2's `globals.rs`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:system/security/keystore2/src/globals.rs),
which memoizes each connection in a `LazyLock` device map), and it does that *before* we're injected. There
is no resolution call left to intercept.

So we intercept the traffic instead. [`keymint_hook.cpp`](keymint_hook.cpp) PLT-hooks
`AIBinder_transact` — the one NDK function every outbound Binder call funnels
through. `HookedTransact` inspects each call and, when it's a KeyMint request we care
about, re-dispatches it to a local binder we own. Everything else calls
`real_transact` (the saved original) and is none the wiser.

Two tests gate a call. `IsHandled(code)` matches the transaction codes we simulate —
`3` generateKey, `4` importKey, `5` importWrappedKey, `6` upgradeKey, `7` deleteKey,
`10` begin, `13` convertStorageKeyToEphemeral, `14` getKeyCharacteristics. (These are
the [AIDL method ordinals](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:hardware/interfaces/security/keymint/aidl/android/hardware/security/keymint/IKeyMintDevice.aidl),
matching the method declaration order in `IKeyMintDevice.aidl`; the AIDL compiler numbers methods from `1` after the
reserved metadata slots.) `IsKeyMintProxy(binder)` confirms the target is actually
the KeyMint proxy and not some other service sharing the `AIBinder_transact` call
site: it compares the binder's class descriptor against `IKeyMintDevice::descriptor`
(it does **not** require `AIBinder_isRemote`). The descriptor is the interface's
fully-qualified name string, stamped on every binder of that type, so it's a reliable
identity check.

We match a *local* `IKeyMintDevice` too, which is why the check does not require
`AIBinder_isRemote`. On a legacy Keymaster (`keymaster@4.x`) backend `keystore2` has no
native KeyMint, so per security level it holds an in-process `km_compat` `IKeyMintDevice`
— stored directly (keymaster 4.0/4.1) or behind a native `BacklevelKeyMintWrapper`
(downlevel) — and the binder that reaches `AIBinder_transact` is that **local** compat
proxy (`isRemote == false`). The **SOFTWARE** level is a `km_compat` device on *every*
device (native included) and is deliberately **not** wrapped: `teesim_router_new_device`
returns `nullptr` for it, so `keystore2`'s software-key path runs untouched. The
descriptor also matches our own local `TeesimKeyMintDevice`, so `IsKeyMintProxy` excludes
it (`IsOurDevice`).

## Re-dispatching the transaction

We cannot take `keystore2`'s parcel and feed it to our own local binder.
`AIBinder_transact` rejects a parcel that wasn't created by `AIBinder_prepareTransaction`
for *that specific* target binder — the parcel carries a header bound to its intended
recipient.

That header is the interface token. Every AIDL transaction parcel begins with a fixed
preamble (a strict-mode policy word, then the interface descriptor string) that the
receiving stub reads back and validates before touching the payload (written by
[`Parcel::writeInterfaceToken`, checked by `Parcel::enforceInterface`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/libs/binder/Parcel.cpp)). `prepareTransaction`
writes this preamble; the arguments are marshalled after it. Two parcels prepared for
two binders of the *same* interface get byte-identical headers, only the payload
differs.

`Redirect` exploits that. It calls `AIBinder_prepareTransaction(local, &my_in)` to get
a fresh parcel already carrying the correct header for our local device, then measures
that header's length with `AParcel_getDataSize(my_in)` before writing anything else —
call it `hdr`. It reads the incoming parcel's full length as `total`, and copies the
payload across with [`AParcel_appendFrom`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/libs/binder/ndk/parcel.cpp):

```
AParcel_appendFrom(*in, my_in, hdr, total - hdr)
```

That copies `keystore2`'s request bytes starting at offset `hdr` (skipping its header,
which is identical to ours) for the remaining `total - hdr` bytes, appending them right
after our header. The result is a valid parcel for `local` holding the original
arguments. We dispatch it with `real_transact(local, code, &my_in, out, flags)`.

One ownership detail: `AIBinder_transact` takes ownership of the input parcel and frees
it (see [ibinder.cpp](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/native/libs/binder/ndk/ibinder.cpp),
where the input parcel is wrapped in an `AutoParcelDestroyer`). Our hook stands in for that call, so callers still expect their `*in` to be consumed.
`real_transact` frees `my_in`; we then `AParcel_delete(*in)` and null it ourselves to
honor the same contract. Skip that and a parcel leaks per KeyMint call.

If anything in the setup fails — `prepareTransaction`, a short parcel, `appendFrom` — we
fall back to `real_transact(proxy, …)` on the original binder, so a redirect that can't
be built degrades to normal behavior rather than breaking the call.

## Simulate or forward

[`keymint_router.cpp`](keymint_router.cpp) defines the local binder, `TeesimKeyMintDevice`, a
`BnKeyMintDevice` that also holds a `shared_ptr<IKeyMintDevice>` to the *real* HAL
(reconstructed from the cached proxy binder via `IKeyMintDevice::fromBinder`). It's
created lazily per proxy and cached in `g_local_for_proxy`.

Being a `Bn…` server means the generated AIDL stub unmarshals the parcel we handed it
into typed C++ arguments and calls the matching method — `generateKey`, `begin`, and so
on. We never parse raw parcels here; we work with `KeyParameter`, `KeyCreationResult`,
`BeginResult`. That's the whole reason we build the AIDL: the `Bn` base classes do the
marshalling, so the router is ordinary typed C++.

Each method decides for itself whether to simulate or forward:

- **Creation** (`generateKey`, `importKey`) acts only for an app assigned to a profile.
  `ProfileForRequest` scans the key parameters for `ATTESTATION_APPLICATION_ID` and matches
  its value against each profile's package names; a request with no attestation app id is
  never a target — an app not asking for attestation has no reason to be handled — and
  non-targets forward to the real HAL untouched. For a target, the profile's mode decides
  *how* (see [Patch and generation modes](#patch-and-generation-modes)).
- **Operations on an existing key** (`begin`, `deleteKey`, `upgradeKey`,
  `getKeyCharacteristics`) route by the blob. `IsOurs(keyBlob)` calls
  `teesim_km_is_marked`: keys the TA mints carry a blob prefix, so later operations on
  them come back to us, while real TEE blobs fail the check and forward. This is what
  keeps a simulated key working end-to-end (generate → begin → update → finish) without
  us having to track handles across calls.
- **Everything else** (`addRngEntropy`, `deviceLocked`, root-of-trust calls,
  `importWrappedKey`, `convertStorageKeyToEphemeral`, …) forwards. Note that a few of
  these are in `IsHandled` and so pass through the local device, but the local device
  just relays them to the real HAL; they're intercepted for uniformity, not simulated.

The method bodies translate between the AIDL types and the TA's flat C ABI
([`teesim_km.h`](../rust/teesim-km/include/teesim_km.h)): `ToKm`/`FromKm` convert a `KeyParameter` to/from a `KmParam`. `FromKm` asks
the TA how a tag's value is represented via `teesim_km_tag_value_kind` (returning a
`KmValueKind`) rather than reading the tag's nibble itself, so the signed/unsigned/width
choice lives only in the Rust side and can't drift (e.g. `USER_AUTH_TYPE` is ENUM-typed
but decoded as an unsigned 32-bit value). `TeesimKeyMintOperation` wraps a TA operation handle and aborts it in the
destructor if `finish` never ran, so a dropped operation doesn't leak state in the TA.

### Hardware, patch and generation modes

A target key can be created in three ways. The distinction is **key ownership**, not what a status
page says:

- **Hardware** is strict. The private/secret key material and key blob must remain in the genuine
  level-specific KeyMint instance. A TEE request must come back with
  `SecurityLevel::TRUSTED_ENVIRONMENT`; a StrongBox request must come back with
  `SecurityLevel::STRONGBOX`. The router rejects a TES-marked blob or a result lacking the exact
  level's `KeyCharacteristics`. There is no software fallback. The in-process TA may re-root a
  returned attestation certificate, but it does not own the business key.
- **Patch** keeps the real hardware key and re-signs only the attestation when the hardware path
  works. It is the compatibility default and may fall back to generation when the hardware level
  cannot serve the request.
- **Generation** mints the whole key in the in-process reference TA. Its blobs are TES-marked and
  later operations route back to that TA.

In strict hardware mode, symmetric keys, StorageKey, auth-bound keys, imported keys, ordinary
asymmetric keys and `ATTEST_KEY` keys all stay on the genuine level-specific HAL. Existing
generation-mode `ATTEST_KEY` blobs are never allowed to drag a new hardware-mode key back into
`Simulate()`; the synthetic parent is discarded and hardware ownership wins.

Remote provisioning is also mode-aware. Compatibility profiles may deny a target app's RKP lookup
on hybrid levels so keystore2 does not append a foreign chain the TA cannot re-root. Strict hardware
profiles never deny RKP: on modern RKP-only devices that registration may be the only attestation
path available to the real TEE/StrongBox, and breaking it would violate the mode's ownership
guarantee.

`PatchAttest` is the forward-plus-re-sign path. When called with `hardware_required=true`, a
failure from the real HAL or an ownership/security-level mismatch is returned to the caller; it
never falls back to `Simulate`.

Attestation keys need special handling:

- In **hardware** mode an `ATTEST_KEY` is generated by the genuine TEE/StrongBox HAL. A delegated
  graph whose parent is also hardware-backed remains entirely in that HAL and is validated at the
  same security level.
- In compatibility **patch/generation** modes the historical software-owned attestation-key graph is
  retained so existing behavior and old blobs continue to work.
- A foreign real-hardware attestation key remains real hardware; the router forwards it rather than
  attempting to use its private half inside the TA.

StrongBox availability is not inferred from a label alone. The daemon's harvest probe now performs a
real StrongBox P-256 generation, ECDSA sign/verify round-trip, parses the attestation, and requires
both attestation and keymaster security levels to report StrongBox before declaring the hardware
backend available.

### Per-level attestation identity

The record's security level and version must match the HAL the request came through: a StrongBox
key claims StrongBox and that HAL's version, a TEE key the TEE's. Each profile builds a separate TA
per level (`Profile::ta_tee` / `ta_strongbox`, selected by `Profile::TaFor`), mirroring a real
device's independent per-level KeyMint instances. The proxy routes every request — and every
operation on one of our blobs (`DefaultTaFor(level_)`) — to the instance for its own level, which is
fixed at construction, so the level and version are never overridden per request and a key's
characteristics are always read at the level it was minted at. The versions are harvested from
throwaway attested keys at each level and carried in the config — or fabricated (TrustedEnvironment
and the OS-appropriate version) when the device has no working hardware attestation; the
`keyMintVersion` is then derived from `attestationVersion` in the TA (Keymaster 4.0 is attestation 3 /
keymaster 4, 4.1 is 4 / 41; KeyMint versions are equal). A broken StrongBox reuses the TEE version.
Patch mode gets this for free — it re-signs the real leaf, whose version fields are already the
hardware's. Both instances share the same key-encryption key (it is level- and profile-independent),
so any of our blobs decrypts under either.

### Recursion guard

Forwarding to the real HAL calls `real_->generateKey(…)` etc., which issues an outbound
Binder call — back through `AIBinder_transact`, back into our hook. Left alone that's
infinite recursion. A `thread_local bool tls_forwarding` breaks it: `ForwardGuard` sets
it (via `teesim_hook_set_forwarding`) around every call into the real HAL, and
`HookedTransact` bails to `real_transact` immediately when it's set. Thread-local, not
global, because unrelated KeyMint traffic on other threads must still be intercepted
while one thread is mid-forward.

Because `IsKeyMintProxy` matches by descriptor alone, `tls_forwarding` is the **only**
thing keeping a forward from recursing: on a legacy backend the real HAL is a *local*
`IKeyMintDevice`, so an unguarded `real_->` call would re-match the descriptor and
re-enter the hook. Every `real_->` call in `keymint_router.cpp` must therefore stay
`ForwardGuard`-wrapped. `IsOurDevice` is a separate safeguard for our *own* local device,
not the forwarding guard.

## Files

- [`keymint_hook.cpp`](keymint_hook.cpp) — the `AIBinder_transact` hook, the KeyMint redirect, the
  remote-provisioning denial for target apps (`IsRkpProvisioning`, gated per level by
  `GetRegIsStrongBox` / `ReadRkpOnly`, with a one-shot `LogRkpPolicySnapshot` of the device's
  rkp_only / enable_rkpd properties at install), and
  `teesim_hook_install`,
  which uses LSPlt to patch the caller's PLT slot for the symbol. It scans `/proc/self/maps`
  and probes only the main executable first — the binder client that issues the KeyMint call
  is linked into it, so that is where `AIBinder_transact` is imported — which avoids LSPlt
  logging a "symbol not found" for every unrelated library. Only if the executable turns out
  not to import it does it widen to a full ELF scan, so coverage is never lost. Either way it
  registers on ELF mappings only (the main executable and `.so` files); feed LSPlt a non-ELF
  mapping (dex, oat, font, apk) and its ELF parser faults.
- [`keymint_router.cpp`](keymint_router.cpp) — `TeesimKeyMintDevice` / `TeesimKeyMintOperation`, the
  patch/generation/forward logic (`PatchAttest`, `Simulate`, `IsAttestKeyRequest`), the
  parcel↔TA translation, per-profile routing (`ProfileForRequest`, by app id then caller uid,
  carrying each profile's mode), `teesim_is_target_uid` for the RKP denial, and the
  config-staging C entry points (`teesim_cfg_begin`, `teesim_cfg_add_profile`,
  `teesim_cfg_commit`) that build a new profile set and swap it in atomically, plus
  `teesim_router_new_device`.
- [`keymint_entry.cpp`](keymint_entry.cpp) — `entry()`, what the injector calls. It reads no
  files: it starts the control server and installs the hook in a no-op state, and
  the daemon then connects and pushes the resolved profiles (keyboxes included). Until a
  profile is pushed nothing is simulated — a keystore without configuration is a no-op,
  not a hazard.
- [`exports.map`](exports.map) — exposes only `entry`; everything else is hidden so our symbols can't
  collide with `keystore2`'s.
- [`libcrypto.syms`](libcrypto.syms) — the BoringSSL symbols the TA needs. In the default build there's no
  bundled crypto: CMake generates a stub `libcrypto.so` (empty functions with the right
  SONAME) from this list purely to satisfy the linker, and at runtime `keystore2`'s own
  `libcrypto` provides the real implementations. The list must stay in sync with what the
  Rust TA actually calls.

## Integration

The injector (`../injector`) loads this library into `keystore2` and calls `entry()`.
The device methods call the Rust TA in `../rust/teesim-km` over the [`teesim_km.h`](../rust/teesim-km/include/teesim_km.h) C ABI;
the TA does the crypto and signs attestations with the keybox. The KeyMint AIDL and the
`frameworks/native` binder headers are built from the `third_party` submodules at build
time (see the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`). The Android 10/11 sibling, `../keystore`,
does the same job for the legacy `keystore` daemon, which apps reach over a different
Binder path.
